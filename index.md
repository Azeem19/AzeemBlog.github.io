### About Me
Robert is completing his master's degree in Data Science in Learning Analytics at Columbia University Teachers College.  Having seen the impact of a supportive community and loving family first hand, Robert's mission is to unlock the capacity of other in his community.  He sees his life’s work focusing on issues of education equity and correctional justice. He is a recipient of the Education Pioneers Fellowship, which helps promising professionals launch careers as leaders in education. Through this fellowship, Robert served as a Data Science Consultant for the NYC Department of Education this past summer.  Robert is currently a Beyond the Bars Fellow at the Columbia University Center for Justice.  The Beyond the Bars Fellowship offers students and community members an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of mass incarceration and social change; and to collaborate with social justice organizers, activists, and academics to plan the annual Beyond the Bars Conference.  Recently Robert has partnered with the W. Haywood Burns Institute, analyzing DOJ incarceration data for the purpose of discerning trends in racial disparities and within the prison, designing data visualizations and research content for the purpose of highlighting the racial disparities within the adult correctional system at the county level for all 50 states.  Robert’s academic work aims to bridge the intersection between social justice advocacy, data analysis, and community capacity building. 

Before returning to school for his Master’s degree, Robert was part of a research team at CEB who partnered with the Obama Administration’s My Brother’s Keeper Initiative.  During this 12 month pro bono project Robert led a team who designed a non-profit Best Practice guide and engineered actionable insights through a combination of executive interviews & research.  Robert is a proud Gates Millennium Scholar, Georgetown Hoya, amateur chef and lover of all things Philadelphia Eagles related.  When he find a free moment he’s either cooking for those he loves or working on his podcast.
